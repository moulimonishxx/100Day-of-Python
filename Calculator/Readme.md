# Python  Calculator

This is a **Scientific Calculator** built with **Python** using the **Tkinter** library. The app features a **Standard** and **Scientific** tab, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic as well as advanced scientific operations. 

This project is part of my **#100DaysOfPython** challenge, where I am focusing on building real-world Python applications to enhance my skills.

## Features

- **Standard Tab**: 
  - Perform basic arithmetic operations: 
    - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
  
- **Scientific Tab**: 
  - Advanced mathematical functions:
    - **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine (`sin`), Cosine (`cos`), Tangent (`tan`).
    - **Logarithmic Function**: Logarithm base 10 (`log`).
    - **Square Root Function**: Calculate the square root of any number.
    - **Pi Value**: Display the accurate value of Pi (`Ï€`).
  
- **User Interface**:
  - Clean, modern, and interactive.
  - Two tabs for easy navigation between standard and scientific functions.
  - Customizable layout with responsive buttons.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python and Tkinter installed on your machine.

### Python Version:
- Python 3.x

### Tkinter:
- Tkinter is included with the standard Python distribution, so no need for additional installation.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://https://github.com/moulimonishxx/100Day-of-Python/tree/main/Calculator
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Calculator
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

## Usage

- Launch the app, and you will see two tabs:
  1. **Standard Tab**: Use this tab for quick arithmetic operations.
  2. **Scientific Tab**: Use this tab for more advanced mathematical calculations.

- Click the buttons to input numbers and operators.
- Press the `=` button to calculate the result.
- Use the `C` button to clear the input.
- Press `Erase` to delete the last character.
